With over 10 years of experience in enterprise and desktop application development, I have a strong background in creating multi-tenant products and designing robust REST APIs using SpringBoot, NestJs, ExpressJs, HapiJs, FastAPI, and Django. 

I am proficient in utilizing design patterns such as Singleton, Factory, and MVC, and skilled in database management, including stored procedures and data migrations. 

My expertise extends to CI/CD pipelines, cloud services (AWS, Azure, DigitalOcean), and system monitoring with tools like PM2. Additionally, I have a proven track record as a team lead, contributing to architectural designs, and integrating payment gateways and Google Sheets.
